# neonatal-pain-detection
This project uses LSTM and GRU models to classify pain levels in neonates based on NICU vital signs data collected over five years from USF's medical lab. Techniques like batch normalization and regularization are applied to enhance accuracy, supporting early pain detection in neonatal care.
